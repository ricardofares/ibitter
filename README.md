# Ibitter: A Twitter-like Social Media App for University Students

Welcome to the Ibitter GitHub repository! Ibitter is social media mobile application designed specifically for university students. Our goal is to provide a platform for students to connect, share their emotions, and exchange experiences within the university environment. Whether you're excited about a recent achievement or need a place to express your thoughts, Ibitter is here to enhance your university journey.

## üéì A College Project

Ibitter is the result of our hard work for the **Programming Topics in New Technologies** course. As a team of dedicated students, we've poured our knowledge and creativity into developing an application that meets the needs of modern university life.

## üìñ Project Overview

The Ibitter project consists of a dynamic front-end, a robust API, and a powerful back-end, all working together to create a seamless user experience.

### Front-end (Mobile Application)

Our front-end is built with modern technologies to ensure a smooth and engaging user interface:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The foundation of our front-end development.
- **React-Native**: Empowering us to create a native-like mobile app experience.
- **Expo**: A toolchain that accelerates our React Native development.

### Back-end (Business Logic)

The back-end of Ibitter is where the magic happens. It provides the necessary services and logic to ensure the application runs flawlessly:

- **NodeJS**: The backbone of our server-side operations.
- **Express**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Our relational database of choice, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation Guide

Getting Ibitter up and running is straightforward. Follow these steps to install the necessary components on your system:

üîî **Note**: Installation steps may vary depending on your operating system. We've provided general guidance, but be sure to adapt them to your environment if needed.

   ```

   Create a database named `ibitter_db`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ibitter_db;
   ```

   Transfer ownership of `ibitter_db` to the `ibitter_user`:

   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE ibitter_db OWNER TO ibitter_user;
   \q
   ```
